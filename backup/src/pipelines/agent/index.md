# Pipeline Agents and Pools

The *Pipeline Agent* is an instance of [the Pipeline Runner software](../runner/index.md) -- using a special 
service account -- to process work on demand.

As our commercial customer we can set up the agent environment for you.

    Before you can set up an agent, you'll need to create at least one *Agent Pool*.
    
    It is a room where agents can look up and wait for work to become available.
    
    To create *Agent pool* you can click the *Create pool* button and a new pool is added to the list 
    in a moment.

    From the *Agent View* new agents can be added to the pool.
    
    When an agent is created, you will receive an *Access Token* from the UI. 
    
    ***This token is displayed only once and should be saved and kept secret***. You will need it later 
    to configure [the Pipeline Runner](../runner/index.md).
    
    From here you can also rename or delete the pool.
