# Pipeline model

Our *Pipeline models* are instructions for the [Pipeline Runner software](../runner/index.md) to 
execute operations on a system.

Usually it is the local system where the software is running. However, our runner has a pluggable 
architecture which could support running actions on another system in the future and to run on 
embedded OpenWRT systems for example.

These models are JSON data structures encoded as UTF-8 character set.

## We have four types of pipeline models

* [*Pipeline*](pipeline.md) defines one or more [*stages*](./stage.md) to be executed in the same order as they are defined
* [*Stage*](stage.md) defines one or more [*jobs*](./job.md) to be executed in parallel at the same time
* [*Job*](job.md) defines one or more [*steps*](./step/index.md) to be executed in the same order as they are defined
* [*Step*](step/index.md) defines a work item to execute

All these models also support [common properties](./common-properties.md), 
[parameters](./parameters.md) and [variables](./variables.md) on their top level.
