# Getting started with Sendanor Pipelines

Our *Pipeline software* can be used to execute action scripts (called *pipelines*) to process data on demand.

It supports a model where *pipelines* can be organized as reusable components and mapped to 
process data from different sources and places.

For example, our [Forms software](../forms/index.md) can be used to bind fields to specific 
pipeline parameters.
