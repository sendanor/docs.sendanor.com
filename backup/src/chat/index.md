# Getting Started with Sendanor Chat

Our *Chat software* can be used to embed interactive chat on any website.

The chat can be integrated to third party services like Discord, IRC, or Matrix network -- and can 
also operate as a pure web chat, independently of these networks.

The chat app is available at [viesti.app](https://viesti.app).
